# 🔧 ISSUE FIXED - Web Server Required

## What Happened

You got a **CORS error** when opening `index.html` directly. This is because:
- The game uses **ES6 JavaScript modules**
- Browsers block modules from `file://` URLs for security
- You need a **web server** to run the game

This is **not a bug** - it's standard for modern web apps!

---

## ✅ Solution: Use the START_SERVER.bat File

I created a batch file that handles everything for you!

### Steps:
1. **Double-click**: `START_SERVER.bat` in the `C:\Claude\shithead_2\` folder
2. A command window opens and starts a server
3. **Open your browser** to: `http://localhost:8000`
4. **Click "New Game"** and play!

## 🎯 What START_SERVER.bat Does

The batch file:
- Checks if you have Python installed
- If yes, starts a Python web server
- If no Python, checks for Node.js
- If yes, starts a Node.js web server
- If neither, shows instructions to install one

## 🚀 Quick Reference

### To Start the Game:
```
1. Double-click: START_SERVER.bat
2. Open browser: http://localhost:8000
3. Click: New Game
4. Play!
```

### To Stop the Server:
- Press **Ctrl+C** in the command window
- Or just close the command window

## 🔍 Why This Happens

Modern JavaScript uses **ES6 modules** (the `import/export` syntax). Browsers consider these security-sensitive and **only allow them over HTTP/HTTPS**, not from local files.

**This is by design** and affects all modern web apps that use modules.

## 💡 Alternatives (If START_SERVER.bat Doesn't Work)

### Install Python (Recommended):
1. Go to: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Download and install
3. Run START_SERVER.bat

### Install Node.js:
1. Go to: https://nodejs.org/
2. Download and install
3. Run START_SERVER.bat

### Use VS Code:
If you have VS Code, install the "Live Server" extension

### Use Chrome with Flags (Not Recommended):
You can disable web security, but this is **not safe**
