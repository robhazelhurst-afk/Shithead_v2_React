# üîß Bug Fixes Applied - Shithead 2

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Swap Phase Added
**Problem**: No way to swap hand and face-up cards at start  
**Solution**: 
- Added interactive swap phase at game start
- Click 2 cards (one from hand, one from face-up) to swap them
- Click "Start Playing" button when done swapping
- Status bar shows clear instructions

### 2. ‚úÖ Face-Down Cards Now Playable
**Problem**: Face-down cards weren't clickable at end game  
**Solution**:
- Face-down cards become clickable when hand and face-up are empty
- Cards flip and play automatically (blind play mechanic)
- Works as per official Shithead rules

### 3. ‚úÖ Double-Click to Play Single Cards
**Problem**: Had to always select and click button  
**Solution**:
- Double-click any single card to play it immediately
- Only works when there's ONE card of that rank
- If multiple cards of same rank, use normal selection
- Speeds up gameplay significantly

### 4. ‚úÖ Fixed Card Overflow
**Problem**: Large hands pushed game areas down the page  
**Solution**:
- Fixed heights for player areas (160px each)
- Fixed height for game container (700px)
- Cards now overlap with -40px margin when hand is large
- Maximum width of 600px for hand zone
- Layout stays stable regardless of hand size

### 5. ‚úÖ Removed Card Transparency
**Problem**: Discard pile cards were transparent  
**Solution**:
- Added `opacity: 1 !important` to all cards
- Removed any transparency effects
- Cards are now fully opaque everywhere

## How to Test the Fixes

### Test Swap Phase:
1. Start new game
2. You'll see "Swap Phase" message
3. Click a card in your hand
4. Click a card in face-up area
5. Cards swap positions
6. Repeat as desired
7. Click "Start Playing" to begin

### Test Face-Down Cards:
1. Play until your hand is empty
2. Play until your face-up cards are empty
3. Face-down cards become clickable
4. Click one - it flips and plays (or forces pickup)

### Test Double-Click:
1. During your turn, double-click any card
2. If it's the only card of that rank, it plays immediately
3. If multiple cards of same rank, nothing happens (use normal selection)

### Test Card Overflow:
1. Pick up a large pile (10+ cards)
2. Cards overlap neatly
3. Game layout stays in position
4. No scrolling needed

### Test Transparency:
1. Look at discard pile
2. All cards should be fully opaque
3. No see-through effects

## Technical Details

### Card Overlap Formula
```css
.hand-zone .card {
    margin-left: -40px; /* Overlap by 40px */
}

.hand-zone .card:first-child {
    margin-left: 0; /* First card no overlap */
}
```

### Container Heights
```css
#game-container {
    height: 700px;
    overflow: hidden;
}

.player-area {
    height: 160px;
    overflow: visible;
}
```

### Double-Click Logic
- Only works for cards that are sole representatives of their rank
- Prevents accidental play of cards you might want to play together
- Makes single-card plays much faster
