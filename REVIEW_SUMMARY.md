# Shithead 2 - Quick Review Summary

## 🎯 What I've Created

I've reviewed your existing Shithead game (from `C:\Claude\shithead`) and past conversations about the game rules and logic. Based on that, I've created a complete specification for Shithead 2 with modern styling and animations.

## 📁 Files Created (ALL SAVED TO DISK)

## 🎨 What's Different from Version 1?

### Original (C:\Claude\shithead)
- ✅ Python + PyQt6 desktop application

**Time estimate: 7 days development**

## 🎬 Animation Highlights

### What You'll See
1. **Deal Animation** - Cards fly from deck to positions (smooth, staggered)
2. **Card Hover** - Lift with shadow increase (feels tactile)
3. **Card Selection** - Gold border, lifts higher (clear feedback)
4. **Play Animation** - Slide from hand to discard (smooth arc)
5. **Draw Animation** - Zoom from deck to hand (feels snappy)
6. **Pickup** - Cards cascade from pile to hand (satisfying)
7. **Burn Effect** - Glow → Fade → Disappear with fire emoji (juicy!)
8. **Face-Down Flip** - 3D rotation reveal (dramatic)
9. **Special Card Glows** - Subtle auras on 2, 7, 10 (helpful)
10. **Turn Indicator** - Pulsing glow around active player (clear)

### Animation Timing
- **Fast**: 150-200ms (hover, selection)
- **Normal**: 250-300ms (card movements)
- **Slow**: 400ms (flips, burns)
- **Stagger**: 50ms delay between multiple cards

All animations use easing curves for natural feel.
