# ðŸŽ¯ Quick Test Guide - Animation Fixes

## All 3 Issues Fixed! âœ…

### Issue 1: âœ… Burn Animation Working
**What was wrong**: render() deleted cards before animation could run
**Fixed**: Animate burn BEFORE calling render()
**Test in game**: Play 4 of same rank â†’ should see flash/glow effect

### Issue 2: âœ… Flip Shows Card Face  
**What was wrong**: Only rotated, never changed from back to face
**Fixed**: Manually swap card content mid-flip
**Test in game**: Play face-down card â†’ should see it flip and reveal

### Issue 3: âœ… Hand Sorted
**What was wrong**: Cards displayed in dealt/random order
**Fixed**: Added sortHand() method, sorts by rank before render
**Test in game**: Look at your hand â†’ should be 2,3,4,5...J,Q,K,A from left to right

## Quick Testing

### Option 1: Test the Fixes Standalone
1. Open `test-fixes.html` in browser
2. Click each button to test:
   - **Test Burn** â†’ Cards should flash/scale/fade
   - **Test Flip** â†’ Card should flip and show Ace of Hearts
   - **Generate Hand** â†’ Should show sorted vs unsorted comparison

### Option 2: Test in Game

2. Start new game
3. Test each fix:

**Test Burn:**

- Console: "ðŸ”¥ Starting burn animation" â†’ "Found cards to burn: X" â†’ "ðŸ”¥ Burn animation complete"

**Test Flip:**
- Play until hand & face-up empty
- Double-click face-down card
- Should see: Card flip from back â†’ edge â†’ reveal face â†’ complete
- Face (rank + suit) should be visible after flip

**Test Sort:**

- Pile clears afterward

### âœ… Flip Works:
- Card rotates to edge (90Â°)
- Card changes from "SHITHEAD" to rank/suit
- Card completes rotation (0Â°)
- Face visible after animation

### âœ… Sort Works:
- Hand shows lowest card leftmost
- Hand shows highest card rightmost
- Order is consistent every render

## If Something's Still Wrong

### Burn still not working?
- Check console for errors
- Verify you see "Found cards to burn: X" (X should be > 0)
- Make sure you played exactly 4 of same rank
- Try hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Flip not showing face?
- Check console for "ðŸ”„ Starting flip animation"
- Verify you're playing a face-down card (not face-up)
- Make sure hand and face-up are empty first
- Check if card HTML changed mid-flip

### Hand not sorted?
- Refresh the page
- Start a new game
- Check if cards are in different order when re-rendered
- Look at rank values (not suits - suits don't affect sort)
