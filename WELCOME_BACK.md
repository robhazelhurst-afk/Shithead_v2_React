## 🤖 AI Behavior

The computer opponent is smart:

### Easy Mode
- Plays random valid cards
- Good for learning

### Medium Mode
- Saves special cards (2, 10) for emergencies
- Completes burns when possible
- Plays lowest valid cards first

### Hard Mode
- All Medium strategies PLUS:
- Sets up four-of-a-kind burns
- Uses 7s tactically
- Plays multiple cards strategically
- Very challenging!

## 🎯 Game Rules (Quick Reminder)

1. **Play equal or higher** than top card
2. **Special cards**:
   - 2: Reset (play on anything)
   - 7: Force low (next ≤7)
   - 10: Burn pile
   - Ace: High (only 2, 10, Ace)
3. **Four-of-a-kind**: Auto burn!
